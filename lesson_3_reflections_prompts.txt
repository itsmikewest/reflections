*** When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your
work local? ***

You'd want to use a remote repository when you're looking to share your work or
there are multiple people who working on a file. Most companies use private
repositories (cloud storage) of their production code, branches, etc

*** Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository? ***

I think it's better to always pull changes manually because I wouldn't want to
have my remote repository always matching what I have in my working directory
or local repository. At this point it looks like you're really pushing more
production ready code to Github. At that you pull when you're looking to work
on things locally. If it's my project I'll typically have everything I need on
my local machine. I can pull from other projects what I need.
