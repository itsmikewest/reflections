*** What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it? ***

When you initialize a repository Git creates a .git directory in whatever
location you're at. It then begins to track the changes that you make to the files
in this location, when you make commits. If you don't initiate there is no way for
.git to track changes or allow for commits. It will let you know what files in a
directory are not being tracked.

*** How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers? ***

The working directory is the current location that files are stored in that you've
navigated to in bash...essentially the current location. The repository is the
actual "container" of sorts that stores the files that have a commit on them.
The staging area is the location that acts as the holding area before becoming a
repository and receiving commits. It allows for files to be separated from the
working directory and prepared for a repository. I don't understand what value this
holds though.
